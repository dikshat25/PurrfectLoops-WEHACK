## Problem Statement

### **[WHES03] Skill-Based Hiring**  
Traditional degrees don‚Äôt always reflect practical skills. Companies struggle to accurately assess a candidate‚Äôs qualifications, experience, and real-world capabilities beyond certifications. This results in:

- **Blind Applications** ‚Äì Candidates apply without assessing their fit, leading to misaligned expectations.  
- **Other Hiring Issues:**  
  - Overwhelming number of applications, making manual screening time-consuming.  
  - Lengthy and inefficient hiring processes.  
  - Lack of objective assessment beyond resumes.  
  - Unconscious bias in traditional hiring methods.
